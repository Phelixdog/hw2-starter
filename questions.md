### (1) For a square NxN flipit problem, what is a **simple** upper bound on the size of the search space (i.e., number of possible states)?  Explain your answer.**

*put your answer here*

### (2) What is a better upper bound for the number of possible states taking rotations and reflections into account? Explain your answer.**

### (3) For a given NxN (for N>1) flipit problem, if a solution is possible, are more than one solutions always possible. Explain your answer.

*put your answer here*

### (4) Is every flipit problem on a 2x2 grid solvable?  Explain how you arrived at your answer.

*put your answer here*

### (5) Is every flipit action reversible.  That is if performing action A in state S1 yields state S2, will performing action A in state S2 yield S1?

### (6) Describe the heuristic you used in your FlipIt_optimal problem in English and explain why it is admissible, i.e., never over-estimates the distance of a state to the nearest goal state.

*put your answer here*

### (6) Describe the heuristic you used in your FlipIt_aggressive problem in English and explain why it is not admissible, i.e., it sometimes over-estimates the distance of a state to the nearest goal state.
