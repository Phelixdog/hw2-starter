## (1) For a square NxN flipit problem, what is a **simple** upper bound on the size of the search space (i.e., number of possible states)?  Explain your answer.

*put your answer here*

## (2) What is a better upper bound for the number of possible states taking rotations and reflections into account? Explain your answer.

*put your answer here*

## (3) For a given NxN flipit problem, if a solution is possible, are more than one solutions always possible. Explain your answer.

*put your answer here*

## (4) Is every flipit problem on a 2x2 grid solvable?  Explain how you arrived at your answer.

*put your answer here*

## (5) Is every flipit action reversable.  That is if performing action A in state S1 yields state S2, will performing action A in state S2 yield S1?

*put your answer here*

## (6) Is every flipit action reversible?  That is if performing action A in state S1 yields state S2, will performing action A in state S2 yield S1?

*put your answer here*

## (7) Describe the heuristic you used in your flipit problem in English and say wheter or not it is admissable (i.e., does it never overestiate the distance to a goal).

*put your answer here*

## (8) If your heuristic is not admissable, desceibe an additional one in English and show hoe to comput it in Python.
