Your task is to use the aima-python search.py package to write a simple system to solve the flipit game using the A* search algorithm. In this game, you are given a NxN grid where each cell holds either a 0 or a 1. If you select a cell, its value "flips" (i.e., changes from from 0 to 1 or vice versa) along with the values of the cells immediately above, below, to the left and to the right. You will be given an initial configuration and must find a sequence of actions to produce a configuration in which all of then cell holds a 0. You must also answer a set of questions about the problem and your solution.
